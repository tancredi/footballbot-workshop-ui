__Temperature near you as a service.__

Use dnode to create an rpc server that allows anyone to query the last known
temperature of a TMP36 temperature sensor.

* Attach temperature sensor to **A0**
* Install dnode `npm install dnode`
* Setup your dnode server to listen on port 1337
* Your rpc endpoint should expose a function called `getTemperature`
* `getTemperature` should callback with the temperature in **celsius**

## Components

- TMP36 - http://node-ardx.org/electronics-primer#tempsensor

> Produces a variable resistance dependant on the ambient temperature.

## Hints

- Remember, you're always working with voltages on pins
- The value from a sensor is a representation of the voltage on that pin
- You'll need to convert that value into a useful temperature reading...
- To create an enpoint, pass dnode an object with your endpoint as a method
- Your endpoint should take a callback and pass the value to it
